              <br><p>Dear Women</p></br>
            <p>I know I never thanked you enough for everything. For the life and grain. For the heart and the pain. The bright old sun is my father. He is the one who keeps me alive. 
              But mother, you're the one who gave me birth. The white lady near my window tells me stories every night. She gives me dreams and hopes. 
              On your lap, her stories make me forget all the scars of the day..every..single..night..</p>
            <p>I sometimes imagine how the world of all men would look like. Maybe there will be no love, or passion or even beauty. There will be no new life for sure. 
              The world of all men will have silence. No song, no music, no poetry. Neither flowers nor the thorns. The sound of hammer and anvil will only roar. 
              Woman, you give it beauty, you make us man.</p>
              <p>Everybody says you are weak. Truth they speak. But you know what, legend says there was a time when all the Gods were unable to fight the evil; 
                when the loss was inevitable, they came together and created one single power. That one was not a man but a woman. Symbol of power or weakness?
                Woman, you're the mother of a crying baby. You're the sister of a helpless brother, the daughter of an old father and the lover of a young man. Woman, you're the one with all.</p>
                <p>Happy Women's Day!</p>

              <p>The weather of Kolkata is always surprising. It was same a few years back on a mid January's morning. The sun was proudly announcing that winter had passed. 
                I was enervated in my full sleeve shirt. I was a little late for the event so I hurriedly opened the gate. And there she was. I saw a teenage girl standing infront of me. 
                In her blue saree she was looking way mature. Her jet black hair just touching her shoulder and through the thick glasses I saw two emerald eyes, shining like crystals. 
                Her lips were half opened between a laughter and a word that she had just withheld from saying. Her perfect skin was glowing like gold. For a moment it seemed that the time slowed down. 
                She took her right index finger and pushed some of her hair behind her ear. Standing there I could feel the blood flowing through my vains, I could feel the pulses in my fingers. 
                That's when a cold wind blew, through her hair touching her cheeks it found home on my lips. With a little shiver down my spine I pronounced 'amen'. 
                Quite expectedly she didn't notice my presence. She decided to go inside and when she turned back, I noticed her hair was longer than that I thought. 
                Within a moment it disappeared with her into the darkness of the room. For a brief moment of time I stood there still, thinking. What was it? 
                The cold wind blew again while the sun burned my skin. It slowly wispered in my ears the most sacred word known to the mankind 'Love'. Love, that is ancient than the sun above. 
                Love, that is purer than the blood in my vain. And love, that I felt just there. Oh you evil fate, I thought, I was brought to my destiny at the most unexpected manner at the most unexpected time. 
                I met my Aphrodite. My life stood still and the whole event started rewinding in my head in an infinite loop. With slow breathing and still limbs my heartbeat spoke again 'amen'.</p>

              <br><p>Dear Monica</p></br>
            <p>Do you remember me? What an odd question to ask at the beginning of a letter after all these years, isn’t it? But after all the formalities, this is where everything will lead. 
              How much do you remember? My face? My name? My work? My address? My number? My letters? Our first date? The long night calls? Us? Oh, I am going too far. 
              I am strong and mature, but I know I am not Richard. I am loving and caring, but I am not chandler either. As one of my favorite song sings “I am just a station on your way, I know I am not your lover” 
              This defines me the best.</p>
            <p>How are you? How is life? I hope you are fine with everything, with your love and your friends. I have stayed there for a while and I know you well, maybe. 
              In your 10 season long series, I was barely an episode. But my novel has only one person. It goes something like this. The prologue starts with a poem when a teenage boy meets a teenage girl. 
              Chapter 1, has introduction. Chapter 2, is long boring wait. Chapter 3, a miracle of fate. Chapter 4, some sweet memories. Chapter 5, the turn of events. Chapter 6, its all my fault. 
              Chapter 7, has rain in it. The pages afterward are wet for some reason. It has dreams and memories, paradoxical blames, and stories of what ifs. But the epilogue is my favorite part. 
              The letters are uneven and scattered, blot of ink made it even harder to read; an abstract and abrupt end of story.</p>
              <p>I know my story won't sell, but at this late hour, sitting at office on a rainy night, when my big glass window outside has little water drops on them making the street lights look bigger; 
                I have only your thoughts to live through. You could never appreciate my love. It was abandoned and unrequited, just like me. And now I am out of my words to start another story, so I'll let it be like this and die with me. 
                Once I go to hell, I will ask God all the questions that I could never ask. He would have to face me then.</p>

            <p>Dear Monica, do you remember me? I am just that guy who loves you. That doesn’t mean you have to do the same, well I know. With all unanswered messages and disconnected phone calls, I received my answers. 
              We are two different human beings with different thoughts and different beliefs; different demands from life. Maybe our dislike is the only a common ground, me. 
              And if we ever meet there, again, I promise to let everything go as if nothing ever happened.</p>
            <p>Say hi to Chandler. Give my love to Errica.</p>

                    <p>"Life always gives you a second chance", they said. They said, "every loser gets a chance to become a winner someday".
                      What about a chance after the second? Or maybe after that? The stories are always about heroes and heroines, sometimes villains maybe​.</p>
                    <p>I wasn't there. The evening, when you walked in the woods, alone. No, I wasn't there. Fireflies lighten up your path.
                        The cool breeze came, passing through the trees, disappeared into your hair. You find serenity in your soul. 
                        That night, when you cried out loud in pain. Your aching heart asked for a gentle kiss on the forehead. 
                        You need someone to talk to, someone who can hold your hand, and you can lie down on his lap to fall a deep sleep, just like a child. 
                        I wasn't there. Or in the early morning, when you had a fight with your father, you were upset. 
                        While going to college you looked at the empty seat beside, you wished for a friend, a companion, a soulmate.​</p>

                    <p>But no, I was none of them. The afternoon when an email confirmed another feather to your crown, and that joy in your eyes was a must to be shared, I wasn't there. 
                        It was a rainy noon of a lazy Sunday. The raindrops on the window made the outside look all blurry. Roads were empty and shops were closed. 
                        When the smoking coffee mug had its last sip left, a teardrop fall in the epilog of the book. You wanted to share this story. But with whom? 
                        No, I wasn't there. When you cried, you laughed, you smile, you giggled, on your happy or sad moments, I wasn't there. 
                        I wasn't there to wish your birthday. I wasn't there that night when you sang your favorite song over the phone. I was never there.</p>
                    <p>Yes, the stories are always about gods and angels and devils.</p>

                    <p>A hot humid afternoon of summer. Burning sun above the head keeping no sign of shadow on the ground. It took her a little effort to open the big rusty gate on her way.
                      With a loud noise, it informed its existence to the world. A cold breeze blew past her ears as she walked in, probably whispering something. 
                      She shivered. Her trembling footsteps on dry leaves made am uneven rustle. She was scared and lonely. But she knew she had to do this alone. 
                      Trees blew again, her hair all messed up. Oh, the beauty of almighty's creation. Naked eyes, messy hair and chapped uneven lips; the untouched beauty of a woman.​</p>
                    <p>As a child, she used to imagine a day like this. She saw herself walking down the aisle dressed in all white, holding roses in her hand, blood-red roses. 
                      The decorated aisle was covered with flowers and around that was her family and friends, cheering, wishing her for a new life, she imagined. 
                      But look at the evil turn of destiny. Today there is no one beside her. 
                      She is walking down the aisle, dressed in white with flowers in her hand, but people are replaced by silent trees and flowers by dead abandoned leaves. 
                      This is the first time she brought any flower for him, a blood-soaked rose, red like blood, fresh like dew. A few more steps will take her there. 
                      Five years were long to forget someone but one single message can dig out long forgotten names from the graveyard of memories. 
                      After all the time, she was finally there, standing in front of him. One single drop of water rolled out of her eyes and then the flood came with the flowing memories. 
                      Her weak knees couldn't hold her standing straight. She fell on the ground.​</p>

                    <p>Red rose on the green grasses gave a contrasting look with an angel sitting beside. 
                        She covered her face with her palm, kneeling down on the ground the lady started crying; long held tears finally broke out. 
                        The clouds above joined with her and the city bathed in its first rain of that summer. With first few drops of water dust on the epitaph removed and a name revealed. 
                        Somewhere in the heaven, God smiled and with the tryst of rain and sunshine, he drew a rainbow in the sky.</p>

                    <p>They say songs don't have languages. They say it can heal any pain, any scar. The truth they speak. 
                      But what they never mention is that one single song can bring back all your memories dug in the graveyard. 
                      It can wash away the lies of dreams over the truths of reality making your emotions naked to the world. How are you? How is life?</p>
                    <p>It's been long since we have last spoken. I am a horrible person, I have been like this for long. 
                      And then one fine morning you decided that you don't want to talk to me anymore. You were right, I was responsible for everything. 
                      Then the blue ticks on my WhatsApp wrote the epilog of a never ending story. Believe me lady, I am stronger now. 
                      Lies don't hurt me anymore, emotions don't matter. But then suddenly one song on the playlist that you neither can hear nor can skip. 
                      It only puts fire to the ashes. Do you remember the day I first suggested you Coldplay? Do you remember how long you took to give it the first shot? 
                      I wish you gave everything the first chance. Do you remember the songs I used to send you every night? 
                      Do you still listen to them? Or are they just gone in time and then deleted like my contact number?</p>
                    <p>I know we don't talk anymore and there is hardly any chance that you'll be reading this now. 
                        So just an anonymous note to the sky, expecting it would find its destination. Because one single song on the playlist can make the November's sky cry. 
                        One drop of rain on the cheek carries the memories of an unrequited love. No matter how yellow the stars become their rays will never make me wanted.</p>

                      <p>A glass of water felt happy and safe. He felt secure and home staying in there. “ it is my destiny”, he thought until one day the scorching heat of summer changed his fate forever. 
                        From his home, he disappeared into the air as vapor. The pain of breaking bonds was unbearable, the change was irresistible. 
                        He tried his best to hold whatever little he had, but when the storm comes it washes everything and in a moment you find yourself in a new place away from known faces. 
                        He felt the same. ​</p>
                      <p>As if his world was destroyed. He made some new friends, the refugee of the same storm, bearer of the same pain. And then one day they all became part of a cloud. 
                        By then he was numb with the pain. He understood that change is the only constant. Time passed by, days turned into months. It was time for him to say goodbye to the cloud. 
                        He was rain now. The dry land awaits for his touch. He can turn a desert into a valley. Yes, that glass of water who once felt content being limited was now feeling the taste of being limitless. 
                        He never knew that even he can be a part of a bigger goal. As a rain, he became a part of the river. He gave her flow he gave her current. When human tried to block her, he destroyed them. 
                        But when they came to ask for help, he gifted them with flowers and fruits. He gifted them food and life. And then the life goes on. 
                        Whenever he becomes impure the burning sun takes his soul and burns him to purity. Changes are still painful but now he knows it's for the greater goal, it’s for the better future. </p>

                      <p>That glass of water, who once was content with the little he had, now dreams to become a part of the sea, to become ocean one day. With a single stroke, his dreams and destiny changed forever. 
                          He bears the scars of the bad times, but he bears the sign as well that even a glass of water can become ocean one day.​​</p>

                    <p><i>December 18, 2016</i></p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                          <p>18th December, 2016. My wrist watch says it’s 1:30 in the morning and I am sitting at Bengaluru airport, about a thousand mile away from home. 
                            I am just one flight away from a new life, just a few hours away from a new dawn. Tomorrow’s sun will either guide me to a beautiful day or its sharp rays will make me blind forever. 
                            But tonight, sitting here while watching the crowd moving, I can remember the people I left behind. Late in the night, when the city sleeps, I made my great escape.​</p>
                          <p>The midnight’s flight allowed me to avoid goodbyes from the loved ones I never wanted to leave, my home and my Kolkata. The city of joy, the city that’s known for its rich culture and food, that is my city, that is my home. 
                            The city that gave me my childhood mornings, my school bus memories, and my college days. My evening walks, and late night sleepovers. 
                            She saw me standing at the bus stop, waiting, she saw me crying in the middle of the road. She witnessed my madness, she witnessed my dreams. 
                            She gave me scars and she gave me lessons. But above all, she gave me love. And she knows that I am addicted to it even after everything she did to me. 
                            Her one kind word could have kept me forever in her arms. So, she never did that. Her goodbye pushed me to the edge and probably it’s for the better.​</p>
                            <p>So to end, to all my friends who are reading this now, I remember you. I remember the memories we made together. Now I close my eyes and I close my note. 
                                I let the whispering wind pass my words to my city, to my love. I will come back because forever is not a myth.</p>

                          <p>"Yes. From my childhood, I dug my roots deep into the soil to stand strong. I have grown from a sapling to a large wooden tree to be able to hold you tight. 
                            Storms made me stronger and I don't fear them anymore now. When I'll blossom you can stand by my side, you can have my fruits and you can tell me your stories, promise I won't judge you. 
                            I'll drink the poison for you to breathe fresh. On the scorching summer, you can take shelter beneath me, and you can walk away when the storm is over. 
                            When you feel to come back, you'll find my arms wide open, exactly where you left. The battle of survival may put some scars on my face, but the heart will remain untouched.</p>
                          <p>I am the tree near your window. I am the green of the autumn and gray of the winter. If you want, tear me down and cut me into pieces. 
                            And then on some frozen night with a smoking coffee mug and Murakami in your hand, you'll find me burning in your fireplace."</p>

                            <p>If I could, I would write a thousand letter to you, to tell you how much I love you. To tell you everything that I could never tell you in person. 
                              Everything that goes on in my mind on each and every moment of the day. I’ll write my heart out and Hedwig will fly a hundred mile just to deliver my messages on the snowy nights.</p>
                            <p>And on some wintery evening when you feel cold and dead from the inside, you can burn them. The flames will heat you up resurrecting your soul. 
                              The fire beneath every word will warm the blood through your vain. When you feel tired and broken and stabbed by the loved ones, you can read them, again and again, remembering every possible past and considering every probable future. 
                              You’ll breathe smooth, closing your eyes you'll see me standing by your side, holding your hand like never before. 
                              You’ll feel a shiver through your body when my fingers will touch your lips and in love, you’ll fall in the deepest sleep. 
                              The night may go darker but the letters and the fire will enlighten you up. I promise to write them with blood, sweat, and tears, and with the love, you never asked for, the forbidden love as I used to say, the impossible love as you used to say. 
                              But on those nights, nothing will be forbidden and everything will be possible. The ashes of my remaining love will heal your scars. 
                              Some of it will fly back to me and I’ll smell your essence on the dying night. From the skin to deep down to your heart, I’ll kill your pain. 
                              If I could, I would write a thousand letter to you so that you can burn them for the fire you need.</p>
                              <p></p>

                                <p>A loud bang on the door. I heard her footsteps disappear into the thin cold air. Old letters gave some extra fuel to the fire in my fireplace. 
                                  The yellow flames with the red core burned each and every sign I had. The weather report said it would be the coldest night of the season, but I was numb to feel any of it.</p>
                                <p>On the floor near the bookshelf, some ants gathered around the broken wine glass to celebrate the feast of a soldier's death. 
                                  It's Christmas time and the gifts are still unwrapped on the table. The hidden love behind those wrappers is not needed to be discovered now. 
                                  When she left, I saw her eyes. She lied. The best ever lie in the history. And now, tonight, those tears will write in her journal the best story ever told. 
                                  The journal that she always keeps in the third drawer of her cupboard, locked, far from the world to see. Those thin pages are the graveyard of her secrets. 
                                  And tonight, I know, a love will be buried for not to be resurrected again. The broken fragments of time will write the last words on its epitaph. 
                                  But where and what did go wrong? Or probably it was our situation that played the evil role of a devil. And now he is smiling somewhere, hiding, seeing us in pain. 
                                  When she pulled the thread it ripped my heart into pieces and left me bleeding. The fire will die soon, so does the night. 
                                  Morning's Sun will burn my eyes with the sharp rays and will tell me how ruined I am, how helpless a man can be when he loses his home. 
                                  But every moment of this night wrote the last words on my stone.​</p>

                            <br><p>Dear lady,</p></br>
                          <p>If I could, I would write a thousand letter to you, to tell you how much I love you. To tell you everything that I could never tell you in person. 
                            Everything that goes on in my mind on each and every moment of the day. I’ll write my heart out and Hedwig will fly a hundred mile just to deliver my messages on the snowy nights.</p>
                          <p>And on some wintery evening when you feel cold and dead from the inside, you can burn them. The flames will heat you up resurrecting your soul. 
                            The fire beneath every word will warm the blood through your vain. When you feel tired and broken and stabbed by the loved ones, you can read them, again and again, remembering every possible past and considering every probable future. 
                            You’ll breathe smooth, closing your eyes you'll see me standing by your side, holding your hand like never before. 
                            You’ll feel a shiver through your body when my fingers will touch your lips and in love, you’ll fall in the deepest sleep. 
                            The night may go darker but the letters and the fire will enlighten you up. I promise to write them with blood, sweat, and tears, and with the love, you never asked for, the forbidden love as I used to say, the impossible love as you used to say. 
                            But on those nights, nothing will be forbidden and everything will be possible. The ashes of my remaining love will heal your scars. 
                            Some of it will fly back to me and I’ll smell your essence on the dying night. From the skin to deep down to your heart, I’ll kill your pain. 
                            If I could, I would write a thousand letter to you so that you can burn them for the fire you need.</p>
                            <p></p>
                          <br><p>With Love.</p></br>

                        <p><i>October 28, 2016</i></p>
                        <div class="row">

                              <br><p>Dear Lily,</p></br>
                              <p>It’s been so many years we have last spoken. I always regret myself for losing you. I thought you would understand my situations but you never did. 
                                I still bear those scars of that evening with me. And I know, now, after so many years, when you are so far, these words just don’t matter. 
                                They won't bring you back from where you are. But this letter today is not for all those untold apologies, unshared stories, and unforgettable memories. 
                                Today it’s about a new boy I met.​</p>
                              <p>Another batch came at Hogwarts today and among the crowd, a bright green eyed boy reminded me of you. He's your son, Lily. 
                                He more looks like his father though, but his eyes are exactly like yours, round, deep, and green, like the ocean, like the one you had, magical. 
                                Years back I fall for them when I was a kid and you were a kid. “Freak” they called you, magic what I saw. I knew you were different, better than the lot. 
                                We were different, from the blossoming flowers, the flying leaves to the blood in our vain, it was none less than a magic that brought us together. 
                                You were right, I was a stacker. But I never had the courage. How could I have? You looked so beautiful in your long red hair, well dressed, like a scared little angel. 
                                And then there was me. But still, we became friends. You were chosen for the Gryffindor and I went to Slytherin. Our houses separated us. 
                                Two friends parted. Houses, your ignorance, a burning rage against those insults from your Gryffindor friends, and my love for the dark arts made me what I was. 
                                Do you forgive me for that? ​</p>

                              <p><img src="img/lily.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
                              <p>That night I tried to save you. I pleaded to Dumbledore to take you to a safe place, I risked my life but in the end, I couldn’t do anything. 
                                  You trusted some wrong friends. But this time I won’t let it happen again. I take this pledge today that no matter what happens, I’ll risk my last drop of blood to save your child. 
                                  He is the last sign of you left and I will not let it erase until I am alive.</p>
                              <p>Stay happy in where you are.</p>
                              <br><p>Yours forever,</p>

                          <p><i>August 31, 2016</i></p>
                          <div class="row">

                                <br><p>Dear Allie,</p></br>
                              <p>I can’t sleep at nights thinking that it is probably over between us, and I wonder where and what went wrong. 
                                When you left New Barn I saw a glimpse of love in those eyes filled with tears. I knew that those were not for the city but for me and us. 
                                I wrote you so many letters after that, expecting some responses. But every letter remained unanswered; and I can’t bear this pain anymore. 
                                Every little thing here in this city reminds me of you and the summer we had together. Now I am moving to New Jersey, searching for a new job, a new life and more, to escape from this ghost of the memories.​</p>
                              <p>I want you to know one thing. From the beginning, I knew that we were different. We came from different worlds, different thoughts; but yet every second I spent with you I felt that I have known you for lives. 
                                Your every word was expected one, your every thoughts and move were as if they were from a long known story. You are the one who taught me the true meaning of love. 
                                You showed me what it is like to care for another, and I am a better man now. I’ll always be grateful to you for this.</p>
                                <p>I want you to know that the night at the carnival when I met those emerald eyes, I knew before the next breath of mine that you are the one I could spend the rest of my life looking for but never find again. 
                                  You seem that good, that perfect. While the wind blew through the trees blowing all your hair, I felt as if a magic happened. The kind of feeling I never felt before.</p>
                                  <p>I believe that the summer we had was real and the love and care I saw in your eyes were all real. The evenings beneath the oak tree and the morning’s canoe ride was more real than anything else in this world. 
                                    And I am not bitter because it ended, but I am happy because it happened because we were together even for a short period of time; and even for a short period of time I saw it in your eyes, heard it in your laughter, it was for me. 
                                    I get to live in that heaven like place, your heart, even for a short period of time. And now when I am leaving a city where I was born and led my life all these years, where my family and friends live; 
                                    I can only look back and see the summer spent with you and its memories.</p>
                                    
                            </div>
                              <div class="col-md-6">
                                <p><img src="img/notebook.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"></p>
                                <p>I believe if in a distant place in future, we meet again in our new lives, I will smile at you thinking about the time we had, together, learning and growing in love. 
                                    And will hope that the incomplete love story of two teenagers can get a new start. And hope, for a brief moment of time you’ll feel the same. 
                                    The wind will blow ruffling up all your hair, again, like that first night, telling the stories of our past and expecting future. Allie, I loved you then, I love you now, and I will love you forever. 
                                    Forever.​</p>

                                  <p>She is a paradox. She is that night, the dark moonlight night, the cold one. A wild breeze that makes everyone shiver. Then she is the morning. 
                                    The golden rays of the sun making the flowers smile.</p>
                                  <p>She is the child, a sweet little one. She has that beautiful smile and confused eyes. Cloudy thoughts making her more beautiful. 
                                    A child who fears about the monsters plays with the dollhouse and sleeps in mommy’s lap. Then she is that matured lady. 
                                    Her voice, her dress, her walk, her choice of words and the decisions of life; a maturity to conquer the world.​</p>
                                    <p>She is the old ethnic goddess. One glance at her and instantly you are in love; a love with a person you will worship throughout your life. 
                                      And then she is this all new. Colorful and glamorous like the people on TV, a little touch of makeup on the face.</p>
                                      <p>She is the lady with the golden heart, queen with the Midas touch. She has the words of peace and smell of love. And then she is a warrior, with the sword in her hand. 
                                        Covered in blood and sweat, she is coming out of the battle conquering the enemies. She has fire in her eyes, a glance that can make you burn.</p>

                                  <p>I believe we will meet again, probably 5 years from now. When we both are grown-ups, mature than ever. We have our own scars we got from life. 
                                    We have our own stories to share, our own mask to wear and our own beautiful lies to avoid the unknowns. Probably we will be too scared to give everything a new chance, too happy with the plastic life. 
                                    When we are used to with the pain inside and we are used to with the fake smile outside. We will ask about life, we will lie about it. And then we will again move on. 
                                    Probably nothing will change but we will meet again.​</p>
                                  <p>I believe we will meet again, probably in 15 years from now, on an unknown street, between unknown faces. Probably at the busiest pedestrian crossing in Tokyo, I’ll have a glimpse of you. 
                                    Or at a small café in a small town near Italy, I will see you have your coffee wearing your thick glasses with a book in your hand. I’ll see you at Time Square during New Year’s Eve. 
                                    Seeing your husband by your side I will probably be too broke to go and talk to you. But I’ll see your smile. We will shout together to New Year. 
                                    Or probably when we are two corporate geeks, we will meet in a corporate meeting where the conversation will start with a good morning and will end with a thank you, the formal one. 
                                    But I believe we will meet again.</p>
                                    <p>We will meet again, probably 50 years from now. When our children are too busy in their lives hardly to spare any time for us. When our stories are too old fashioned to our grandchildren. 
                                      When we are too bored with our daily life. The dreamless dawns and the sleepless nights. We will meet down the memory lane. The old messages and emails will make us smile. 
                                      My praises will make you blush even then. That smile on the wrinkled face, that pink cheek, I know, will be more beautiful than a red rose after its bath of the first rain. 
                                      We will live in memories. But I believe we will meet again.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>Or probably even late. We will meet at the heaven’s gate, just like the first time. You will be busy in your work, with the people around you; and I will again fall for that beautiful smile. 
                                        The wild breeze will ruffle up your hair making it all messy, making you even more beautiful. The dark eyeliner will make your eyes even deeper to create a dark aura around you; just the darkness you like. 
                                        And in that darkness, you are the brightest star. Probably that day I’ll have the courage to tell you about my feelings. Probably in the silence you will hear my fast heartbeats beating like a rhythmic drum. 
                                        You will smile and I will smile and our eyes will meet promising a better future. I don’t know everything will be this dreamy or not, but I do know that we will meet again, in a new world, in a new universe, in a beautiful place. 
                                        No matter what may happen, we will meet again.​</p>
